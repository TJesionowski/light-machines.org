# Who are you?

We‚Äôre an informal meetup group that gathers once a month to discuss
topics of interest. Discussion generally (but not exclusively) focuses
on posts by members of the "rationalist" community such as [Scott
Alexander](https://www.astralcodexten.com/) and [Patrick
McKenzie](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/).

## What do you guys do?

We meet up every month or so to talk about our particular nerdy
interests, hang out, and occasionally learn something. (Crazy right?)
